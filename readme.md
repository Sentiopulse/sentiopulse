# SentioPulse | Web Application

This repository contains the source code for the SentioPulse web application. This is the primary, user-facing platform where users can view market sentiment data, manage their accounts, and configure alerts.

### Core Purpose

The purpose of this application is to provide a clean, fast, and intuitive interface for the sentiment data produced by our backend pipeline. It consumes a private API to deliver insights to our users.

  * **User Dashboard:** Displays a real-time feed of classified sentiment signals with robust filtering and search capabilities.
  * **Authentication & Subscriptions:** Handles user sign-up, login, profile management, and premium subscriptions via Stripe.
  * **Custom Alerts:** Allows premium users to create and manage highly specific, real-time alert criteria for delivery to Discord.
  * **Reporting:** Renders automated daily and weekly summary reports of the most significant market chatter.

-----

### Tech Stack

This application is built with a modern, full-stack TypeScript approach.

  * **Framework:** **Next.js 15** (App Router)
  * **Language:** **TypeScript**
  * **Styling:** **Tailwind CSS** with **shadcn/ui** for components
  * **Authentication:** **Arctic & Rainbowkit Wallet**
  * **Data Fetching:** Next.js Server Actions
  * **Hosting:** **Vercel**

Our backend data pipeline, which is managed in separate repositories, processes the raw data and serves it to this application via a private API backed by a PostgreSQL database.
